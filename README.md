# DishOut
Programing Project OCR

# You will need to activate the virtual env and download the libraries
- Need python 3.11.1 may still work with newer or older ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
- First make sure you have pipenv installed as a package on your python
- Open the terminal in the base folder and run pipenv install

# To run this:
1. Run the RunENV.bat
2. CD to the Dishout folder
3. Type python manage.py runserver
4. Should run the server and give you a local IP in order to connect to it
5. Paste that IP into a web browser or CTRL + Click on it in the terminal on Windows 11
